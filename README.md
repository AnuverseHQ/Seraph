# Seraph

Seraph is a FrontEnd library designed to simplify data interconnection between the frontend, backend, and databases. Inspired by systems like Supabase and Firebase, Seraph function as a proxy to interact with APIs, while providing a streamlined interface for performing CRUD operations seamlessly.

Currently, this project is a work in progress with no code yet, and it draws inspiration from established API management systems. The goal of Seraph is to offer developers a flexible and intuitive way to handle data-driven API calls while maintaining consistency and security.

## Features (Planned)
- **Simplified API calls** with built-in support for CRUD operations.
- **Flexible configuration** for connecting various data sources.
- **Integration with backend systems** like Throne for a unified data handling experience.
- **Language support extension** for omni-platform accessibility.

## Getting Started
This project is still in the early stages, and the codebase will be developed and released incrementally. Stay tuned for updates as we work on building the core functionality!

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from developers interested in making Seraph a reliable and easy-to-use library. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests as the project evolves.
